# Project Outline
Using an SQL based database (using a container instance of your choice), create a database to store the following information:
- Basic client information - includes client name, date of birth, main/secondary languages as well as primary “funding source”.
- Funding sources - options are NDIS, HCP, CHSP, DVA, HACC

Using node.js and express.js, create a REST API with basic CRUD endpoints to create and manage clients which utilises the above SQL database.

Finally, create a simple React and TypeScript front end to list and create clients using the above API.
